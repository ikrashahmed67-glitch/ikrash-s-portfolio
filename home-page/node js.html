    <h1>Node.js Developer (2012–2015)</h1>
    <img src="./assets/node js.png" alt="Node.js Developer">
    <div class="section">
        <p>From 2012 to 2015 I transitioned into backend-focused JavaScript development, primarily using Node.js. At
            that time Node.js was rapidly maturing and offered a productive platform for building APIs, real-time
            features and lightweight services. My work focused on designing reliable server-side services, integrating
            databases, and creating APIs consumed by frontends and mobile clients.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Core Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Designing and implementing RESTful APIs using Express.js and Koa where suitable.</li>
            <li>Database design and integration — MySQL for relational needs and MongoDB for flexible document storage.
            </li>
            <li>Authentication and authorization flows using JWT and session-based mechanisms.</li>
            <li>Building microservices and background workers for asynchronous tasks (email, image processing, scheduled
                jobs).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Representative Projects</h2>
        <p>I built an order-processing API for an e-commerce pilot that supported product catalogs, carts, and payments.
            The service handled concurrent requests, rate limiting and included idempotency for safe retries. Another
            project involved building a real-time chat system with socket.io, handling message delivery, presence, and
            reconnect logic for unstable network conditions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Technical Highlights</h2>
        <p>I gained hands-on experience with Node’s event loop and asynchronous patterns (callbacks ➜ promises ➜
            async/await). I learned to optimize memory footprint, manage long-running connections and gracefully handle
            process restarts using process managers (pm2). I also implemented logging and monitoring using tools like
            Winston and integrated basic health checks for containerized deployments.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Testing & Reliability</h2>
        <p>Writing unit and integration tests was a priority to ensure API stability. I used testing stacks (Mocha/Chai,
            Sinon) and created CI pipelines that ran tests on each commit. Load testing helped identify bottlenecks; we
            introduced caching layers (Redis) and query optimizations to improve throughput and lower latency.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
        <p>During this period I implemented input validation, sanitized database queries to prevent injections, and set
            up rate limiting to mitigate abuse. Secure storage of secrets and environment-based configuration became
            routine, and I adopted an approach of least privilege for service accounts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Legacy & Modern Relevance</h2>
        <p>The Node.js backend experience taught me true full-stack thinking: how frontend decisions affect API shape
            and how server constraints influence UX. Many patterns from these years (stateless APIs, microservices,
            async workers) are still core to modern architectures. I continue to apply these principles when designing
            scalable, resilient services.</p>
