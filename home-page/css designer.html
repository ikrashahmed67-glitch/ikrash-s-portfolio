    <h1>CSS Designer (2020–2022)</h1>
    <img src="/assets/css designer.png" alt="CSS Designer">
    <div class="section">
        <p>From 2020 to 2022 my focus turned to visual systems, animations and design-to-code fidelity. As responsive
            design matured, emphasis shifted to reusable design tokens, consistent spacing systems, dark/light themes,
            and a component-first styling approach. My work aimed to bridge the gap between design intent and
            implementation while keeping code scalable.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Core Work</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating and maintaining a design token system for colors, spacing and typography to ensure consistency
                across products.</li>
            <li>Building accessible, responsive components (buttons, forms, cards) with clear API and shallow coupling
                to business logic.</li>
            <li>Implementing smooth micro-interactions and CSS-driven animations that enhance perceived quality without
                harming performance.</li>
            <li>Implementing themes (dark/light and high-contrast) and ensuring visual accessibility across contrast
                ratios and font sizes.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Tools & Techniques</h2>
        <p>I used modern CSS features: custom properties (CSS variables) for tokens, grid & flexbox for layouts, and
            container queries where supported. I also worked with preprocessors and utility-based systems where
            appropriate to speed up development, while keeping an eye on generated CSS size and runtime performance.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Performance & Accessibility</h2>
        <p>Animations were implemented in ways that avoid layout thrashing (transform & opacity), and I used
            prefers-reduced-motion to respect user preferences. All components were audited for contrast and keyboard
            navigation to meet core accessibility standards.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>The result was a cohesive visual language that allowed product teams to build interfaces faster with fewer
            regressions. A small style system I helped build reduced CSS duplication and improved the speed of
            implementing new screens by providing ready-to-use building blocks.</p>
