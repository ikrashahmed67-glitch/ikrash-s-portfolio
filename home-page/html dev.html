    <h1>HTML Developer (2010–2012)</h1>
    <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/128/16913/16913191.png" alt="HTML Developer">
    <div class="section">
        <p>Between 2010 and 2012 I worked intensively as an HTML developer, focusing on building reliable, accessible
            and performance-minded user interfaces for small-to-medium sized web projects. This period was formative:
            browsers were rapidly improving, mobile browsers were emerging, and standards such as HTML5 and CSS3 were
            becoming stable. My role required translating visual mockups into robust, semantic HTML that worked across
            major browsers and degraded gracefully on legacy platforms.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Turning designs (Photoshop / Sketch at the time) into pixel-accurate, semantic HTML templates.</li>
            <li>Implementing responsive layout patterns using early CSS techniques and progressive enhancement to ensure
                cross-device compatibility.</li>
            <li>Ensuring accessibility basics — proper heading structure, alt text, keyboard navigability and semantic
                markup for assistive technologies.</li>
            <li>Optimizing page load by minimizing DOM size, compressing assets and inlining critical styles where
                appropriate.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Notable Projects & Achievements</h2>
        <p>I helped launch multiple brochure-style websites and small web applications where the frontend needed to be
            stable across Internet Explorer variations, Firefox and early mobile browsers. One project reduced
            first-contentful-paint by 40% through asset optimization and by deferring non-critical scripts. Another
            project involved converting an existing legacy table-based layout into a semantic, CSS-driven layout —
            improving maintainability and SEO performance.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Technical Skills Developed</h2>
        <p>While working as an HTML developer I developed a deep understanding of semantic markup, microformats, and
            best practices for SEO-friendly HTML. I became proficient with tooling of the era, including build scripts
            to concatenate and minify assets, and started using version control (Git) to manage releases. I also learned
            to write maintainable markup by organizing components as reusable templates, which made handoffs to backend
            engineers smoother.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Challenges & Problem Solving</h2>
        <blockquote>Supporting older browsers while keeping code modern and maintainable was a daily challenge.
        </blockquote>
        <p>Common issues included CSS inconsistencies and the lack of standardized behavior across browsers. I solved
            these by adopting progressive enhancement — building a solid HTML foundation, then layering CSS and
            JavaScript. For critical layout issues, I used feature detection and small polyfills to bridge gaps without
            breaking more capable browsers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Impact & Learnings</h2>
        <p>This phase established my attention to detail and respect for standards. Writing semantic HTML reduced
            content-reflow bugs and improved accessibility. Optimizations introduced then are still fundamental to
            modern performance engineering: lazy-loading non-critical resources, reducing asset size, and delivering
            meaningful HTML early to the browser.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>How this experience shapes my work today</h2>
        <p>The HTML-first mindset from these years still guides how I structure new projects: solid semantics,
            accessibility-first components, and performance-conscious design decisions. Modern frameworks abstract some
            of these concerns, but the core principle — deliver meaningful markup as early as possible — remains central
            to everything I build.</p>
