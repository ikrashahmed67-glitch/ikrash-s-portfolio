    <h1>JavaScript Developer (2018–2020)</h1>
    <img src="./assets/js developer.png" alt="JavaScript Developer">
    <div class="section">
        <p>Between 2018 and 2020 I focused on advanced JavaScript engineering: improving application architecture,
            performance engineering, and building developer-friendly libraries. This era emphasized modular code,
            tooling, and measurable UX improvements driven by performant JavaScript.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Responsibilities & Focus Areas</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Writing modular, well-documented libraries and utilities to be reused across projects.</li>
            <li>Performance profiling and optimizing runtime bottlenecks in large single-page apps.</li>
            <li>Implementing advanced client-side features: optimistic UI updates, offline-first strategies, and service
                workers for caching.</li>
            <li>Mentoring junior developers and establishing best practices for code structure and testing.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Representative Work</h2>
        <p>I created a small, reusable UI toolkit that reduced the time to ship new pages by abstracting common patterns
            (modals, dropdowns, toast notifications). For an analytics application, I rewrote critical rendering paths
            to use requestAnimationFrame and web workers to offload heavy calculations — the perceived responsiveness
            improved dramatically.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Progressive Web App & Offline</h2>
        <p>I built features that improved reliability under poor network conditions: service workers for offline
            caching, background sync for queued actions, and clear offline UIs. This reduced user friction and allowed
            some app flows to complete even without an active connection.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Testing & Tooling</h2>
        <p>I emphasized testability — writing unit tests, running snapshot tests for UI components, and using headless
            browser tests for critical user flows. I set up local dev environments and scripts that made onboarding new
            team members much faster.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>The work resulted in measurable improvements: lower error rates, faster load times, and faster developer
            iteration cycles. This period strengthened my belief that engineering discipline (tests, docs, small
            components) scales better than one-off quick fixes.</p>
