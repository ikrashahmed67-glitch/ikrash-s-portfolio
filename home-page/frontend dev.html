    <h1>Frontend Developer (2015–2018)</h1>
    <img src="/assets/frontend developer.png" alt="Frontend Developer">
    <div class="section">
        <p>Between 2015 and 2018 my work shifted to modern frontend development: complex single-page applications,
            component-driven UIs, client-side routing and state management. This was the era when frameworks like React
            and Vue gained momentum; I began building interactive applications that required careful client-side
            architecture for performance and maintainability.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Primary Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Architecting component libraries and reusable UI primitives for consistent design systems.</li>
            <li>Implementing client-side routing, lazy loading of modules and code splitting for optimal load times.
            </li>
            <li>State management using Redux/Vuex or lightweight context patterns for predictable data flow.</li>
            <li>Unit testing and E2E tests to prevent regressions during frequent releases.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Projects</h2>
        <p>I led the frontend build for a data-heavy dashboard used by internal teams to visualize KPIs. This required
            optimizing charts, virtualized lists for large datasets, and careful memoization to avoid expensive renders.
            Another project focused on internationalization and RTL support for multiple locales — I designed the app to
            swap text direction and load locale bundles dynamically.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Performance & UX</h2>
        <p>Performance became a primary goal: metrics like First Contentful Paint and Time to Interactive shaped design
            decisions. I used tools like Lighthouse to guide improvements, implemented server-side rendering (SSR) where
            SEO mattered, and optimized asset delivery with HTTP/2 and CDN strategies.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Collaboration & Process</h2>
        <p>Working closely with designers and backend engineers increased my appreciation for clear contracts (API
            specs) and design tokens. I participated in code reviews, created technical RFCs for major changes, and
            established CI pipelines that ran a battery of tests and linting steps to catch issues early.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Outcome & Growth</h2>
        <p>This period solidified my ability to build scalable, maintainable frontends. I gained fluency in
            component-driven development and a deep appreciation for developer experience — clean APIs, good
            documentation, and small focused releases that keep projects healthy.</p>
